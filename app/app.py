    So how do we actually measure the effect of the changing of water sources for the Lambeth Company? The best way to think about this
    is assuming we had all the information possible. If we did, then we could take the difference between Lambeth's cholera death rate in 
    1854 after moving water sources and Lambeth's cholera death rate in 1854 had they never switched water sources. Sadly, the reality
    is that Lambeth did switch water sources, so we can never know what the death rate would have been in 1854 had they never switched. 
    But, with the difference-in-difference design, we can make some assumptions to estimate it.
                
    Difference-in-difference assumes **parallel trends** between Lambeth and and Southwark & Vauxhall. This means that we are assuming 
    that if Lambeth had never switched water sources in 1852, then their cholera death rate would have trended the same as Southwark &
    Vauxhall's death rate. Remember, Southwark & Vauxhall never switched water sources. We can see this in the graph above. 
    Notice how solid blue line and dotted red line are parallel? 
                
    With this assumption, we can estimate the cholera death rate for Lambeth in 1854 to be Lambeth's death rate in 1849 + the trend of 
    Southwark & Vauxhall from 1849 to 1854. Then we have everything we need to estimate the effect! The steps are below. For some 
    clarification on notation, $Y$ is the outcome of interest (cholera death rate per 100,000). Counterfactual means that the outcome
    never actually occurred.
