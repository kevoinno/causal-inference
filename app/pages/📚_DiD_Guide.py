So how do we actually measure the effect of the changing of water sources for the Lambeth Company? The best way to think about answering this problem
is assuming we had all the information possible. If we did, then we could take the difference between Lambeth's cholera death rate in 
1854 after moving water sources and Lambeth's cholera death rate in 1854 had they never switched water sources. However, the reality
is that Lambeth truly switched water sources, so we can never know what the death rate would have been in 1854 had they never switched. 
But, with the DiD design, we can make some assumptions to estimate it.
            
Let's examine each identification assumption in the context of this study:

**1. Parallel Trends Assumption**: Parallel trends likely holds because both water companies served similar areas of London (neighboring households). This means that any outside factors that affect cholera death rate such as the quality of healthcare would be similar between the treated and untreated groups.

**2. SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)**: The validity of SUTVA can be debated. People can argue that there are spillover effects between households. If Southwark customers contracted cholera from contaminated water, they could spread the disease to their Lambeth-using neighbors through human contact, even though the water companies served different households. However, we believe this violation is likely minor because cholera is primarily waterborne rather than person-to-person transmitted, and mobility was limited in 1850s London, reducing the scope of potential spillover effects.

**3. No Anticipation Effects**: In this example, we believe the no anticipation assumption likely holds because the water source changes were not publicly announced in advance, and there was limited public awareness of the connection between water quality and cholera transmission. People in 1850s London did not understand that cholera was waterborne, so they would not have changed their behavior in anticipation of the water source change. The treatment appears to have been implemented without public knowledge, making anticipation effects unlikely.
            
With this assumption, we can estimate the cholera death rate for Lambeth in 1854 to be Lambeth's death rate in 1849 + the trend of 
Southwark & Vauxhall from 1849 to 1854. Then we have everything we need to estimate the effect! The steps are below. For some 
clarification on notation, we'll use $E[Y_d(t)|D]$ where $d$ indicates the potential treatment status (0 for control, 1 for treated), $t$ indicates the time period (0 for pre-treatment, 1 for post-treatment), and $D$ indicates the observed treatment assignment.

st.markdown("""
One tricky part of this proof is in going from line 3 to 4. Here, we assume $E[Y_0(0) | D = 1] = E[Y_1(0) | D = 1]$. This is saying the potential outcomes 
in the pre-treatment period for the treated group are the same had the treated group received treatment or not. This makes sense, because this is before the
treatment was applied, so the potential outcomes in the pre-treatment period should be the same for the treated group. After we make this assumption, the rest
of the proof follows by consistency.   

This final expression shows that the ATT can be identified as the difference between:
1. The change in outcomes for the treated group from pre- to post-treatment
2. The change in outcomes for the control group from pre- to post-treatment
