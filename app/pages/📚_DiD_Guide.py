To estimate the causal effect of switching water sources on the cholera death rate for households that used Lambeth, the DiD design tries to estimate 
what the cholera death rate for Lambeth households would be in 1854 **had Lambeth never switched water sources**. In practice, we will never know this exact value, but
the DiD design assumes that the death rate for Lambeth households would have trended similarly to the death rate for Southwark households, allowing us to estimate what
the Lambeth cholera death rates would have been in 1854 had they never switched water sources. This is known as the **parallel trends** assumption. In the graph above,
we see the parallel trends assumption as the dotted red line (Lambeth's cholera death rate had they never switched) and the blue line (Southwark's cholera death rate) are parallel.
            
Let's examine see if making these identification assumptions (specifically parallel trends) are feasible:

**1. Parallel Trends Assumption**: Parallel trends likely holds because both water companies served similar areas of London (neighboring households). This means that any outside factors that affect cholera death rate such as the quality of healthcare would affect both groups similarly.

**2. SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)**: The validity of SUTVA can be debated. People can argue that there are spillover effects between households. If Southwark customers contracted cholera from contaminated water, they could spread the disease to their Lambeth-using neighbors through human contact, even though the water companies served different households. However, we believe this violation is likely minor because cholera is primarily waterborne rather than person-to-person transmitted, and mobility was limited in 1850s London, reducing the scope of potential spillover effects.

**3. No Anticipation Effects**: In this example, we believe the no anticipation assumption likely holds because the water source changes were not publicly announced in advance, and there was limited public awareness of the connection between water quality and cholera transmission. People in 1850s London did not understand that cholera was waterborne, so they would not have changed their behavior in anticipation of the water source change. The treatment appears to have been implemented without public knowledge, making anticipation effects unlikely.
            
Using these assumptions, we have: 
    
1. Lambeth's observed cholera death rate was in 1854

2. An estimate of Lambeth's cholera death rate in 1854 if they never switched sources

So taking the difference between **(2)** and **(1)**, we can estimate the causal effect. The graph above provides a nice visual of how the DiD design works. For clarification on notation, we'll use $E[Y_d(t)|D]$ where $d$ indicates the potential treatment status (0 for control, 1 for treated), $t$ indicates the time period (0 for pre-treatment, 1 for post-treatment), and $D$ indicates the observed treatment assignment.

treatment was applied, so the potential outcomes in the pre-treatment period should be the same for the treated group. After we make this assumption, the rest
of the proof follows by consistency.
