# So how do we actually measure the effect of the changing of water sources for the Lambeth Company? The best way to think about this
# is assuming we had all the information possible. If we did, then we could take the difference between Lambeth's cholera death rate in 
# 1854 after moving water sources and Lambeth's cholera death rate in 1854 had they never switched water sources. Sadly, the reality
# is that Lambeth did switch water sources, so we can never know what the death rate would have been in 1854 had they never switched. 
# But, with the difference-in-difference design, we can make some assumptions to estimate it.
            
# Difference-in-difference assumes **parallel trends** between Lambeth and and Southwark & Vauxhall. This means that we are assuming 
# that if Lambeth had never switched water sources in 1852, then their cholera death rate would have trended the same as Southwark &
# Vauxhall's death rate. Remember, Southwark & Vauxhall never switched water sources. We can see this in the graph above. 
# Notice how solid blue line and dotted red line are parallel? 
            
# With this assumption, we can estimate the cholera death rate for Lambeth in 1854 to be Lambeth's death rate in 1849 + the trend of 
# Southwark & Vauxhall from 1849 to 1854. Then we have everything we need to estimate the effect! The steps are below. For some 
# clarification on notation, we'll use $E[Y_d(t)|D]$ where $d$ indicates the potential treatment status (0 for control, 1 for treated), $t$ indicates the time period (0 for pre-treatment, 1 for post-treatment), and $D$ indicates the observed treatment assignment.
